# Day26 AddBinary

- [ ] Problem link: https://leetcode.com/problems/add-binary/description/
- [ ] Description: Given two binary strings a and b, return their sum.
- [ ] Example 1:
- Input: a = "11", b = "1"
- Output: "100"
- [ ] Example 2:
- Input: a = "1010", b = "1011"
- Output: "10101"

- [ ] Approach:
- Convert binary strings to integers
- Add the integers
- Convert the result back to binary string
- Return the result

- [ ] Code: Solution26.java

- [ ] Time & Space Complexity:
- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the binary strings
- Space complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the binary strings
