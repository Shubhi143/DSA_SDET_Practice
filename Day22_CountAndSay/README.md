# Day22 CountAndSay

- [ ] Problem link: https://leetcode.com/problems/count-and-say/description/
- [ ] Description: The count-and-say sequence is a sequence of digit on an infinite loop
as follows:
1.
1
11
21
1211
111221
...
Given a positive integer n, generate the nth sequence.
- [ ] Example 1:
Input: n = 1
Output: "1"
- [ ] Example 2:
Input: n = 4
Output: "1211"

- [ ] Approach:
- [ ] The problem can be solved by using a loop to generate the sequence.
- [ ] In each iteration, we count the number of consecutive digits and append the count and th
e digit to the result string.

- [ ] Code:
Solution22.java

- [ ] Time & Space Complexity:
- [ ] Time complexity: O(n * m), where n is the number of iterations and m
is the maximum length of the sequence.
- [ ] Space complexity: O(n * m), where n is the number of iterations and m
is the maximum length of the sequence.
