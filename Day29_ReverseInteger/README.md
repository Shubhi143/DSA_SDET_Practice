# Day29 ReverseInteger

- [ ] Problem link: https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-integer/description/
- [ ] Problem description: Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.
- [ ] Example 1:
- Input: 123
- Output: 321

- [ ] Approach:
- We will use a while loop to reverse the integer.
- We will use the modulo operator to get the last digit of the integer.
- We will use integer division to remove the last digit from the integer.
- We will use a variable to store the reversed integer.
- We will use a while loop to check if the reversed integer is within the range of 32
- bit signed integer.
- We will return the reversed integer.

- [ ] Code:
Solution29.java

- [ ] Time & Space Complexity:
- Time complexity: O(log(n))
- Space complexity: O(1)
