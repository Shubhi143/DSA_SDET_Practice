- [ ] Problem description:
You are given a list of integers representing the number of coins in each bag. You can take at
most one coin from each bag. The goal is to maximize the total number of coins you can get
from the bags. You can take coins from any bag, but you cannot take more coins from a
bag than the number of coins it contains.



- [ ] Approach:

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy algorithm. The idea is to sort the bags in
descending order of the number of coins they contain. Then, we iterate over the sorted
bags and take as many coins as possible from each bag. This way, we maximize the total
number of coins we can get.

- [ ] Time & Space Complexity:
Time complexity: O(n log n) due to sorting.
Space complexity: O(n) for sorting.
