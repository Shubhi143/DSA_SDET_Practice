- [ ] Problem link: https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-array/description/
- [ ] Problem description: Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps,
where k is non-negative.
- [ ] Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7],
k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5
6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4
5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3
4]

- [ ] Approach:
we can use recursive calling of reverse array

- [ ] Code:
Solution11.java

- [ ] Time & Space Complexity:
- [ ] Time complexity: O(n)
- [ ] Space complexity: O(n)
