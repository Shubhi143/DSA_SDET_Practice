# Day20 RotateImage

- [ ] Problem link: https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-image/description/
You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image, rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.

Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
Output: [[7,4,1],[8,5,2],[9,6,3]]

- [ ] Approach:
- Transpose the matrix
- Reverse each row

- [ ] Code:
Solution20.java

- [ ] Time & Space Complexity:
- Time complexity: O(n^2)
- Space complexity: O(1)
