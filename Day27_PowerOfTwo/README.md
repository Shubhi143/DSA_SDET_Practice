# Day27 PowerOfTwo

- [ ] Problem link: https://leetcode.com/problems/power-of-two/description/
- [ ] Problem description: Given an integer n, return true if it is a power of two
- [ ] Example 1:
- Input: n = 8
- Output: true
- Explanation: 8 is a power of two (2^3)
- [ ] Example 2:
- Input: n = 3
- Output: false

- [ ] Approach:
- A number is a power of two if it has exactly one bit set to 1 in
its binary representation. We can use bitwise operations to check
this.
