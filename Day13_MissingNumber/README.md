- [ ] Problem description:
Given an array nums containing n distinct integers in the range [0, n], find the missing integer

- [ ] Approach:
- [ ] Step 1:
The problem can be solved using the mathematical formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. The sum of
an arithmetic series is given by the formula: sum = n * (a1 + an) /
2, where n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and an is
the last term.
- [ ] Step 2:
We can calculate the sum of the given array using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.
- [ ] Step 3:
Then, we can calculate the sum of the range from 0 to n using the same formula.
- [ ] Step 4:
The missing number is the difference between the two sums.
- [ ] Step 5:
We can return the missing number as the result.
