https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-prefix/description/

- [ ] Problem description:
Write a function to find the longest common prefix among a list of strings.
- [ ] Problem constraints:
- The input list of strings is not empty.
- All strings in the list are of the same length.
- The strings are not empty.
- The strings are not null.
- [ ] Problem example:
Input: ["flower","flow","flight"]
Output: "fl"



- [ ] Approach:
The problem can be solved by iterating over the characters of the strings in the list and comparing them.


- [ ] Code:
Solution31.java

- [ ] Time & Space Complexity:
Time complexity: O(n*m) where n is the number of strings and m is the length of
each string.
Space complexity: O(1) as we are not using any extra space that scales with input siz
e.
